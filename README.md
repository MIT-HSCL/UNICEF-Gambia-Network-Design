# UNICEF-Gambia-Network-Design
This project builds an optimization model for immunization network design that aims to maximize the access to immunization and incorporates the demand function which considers the effect of distance.

This work was completed as part of an [MIT SUpply Chain Management](https://scm.mit.edu/) Capstone Project (May, 2020): [Development and Application of an Immunization Network Design Optimization Model](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/126392)

# Toy Model:
This code was used to develope the initial problem and state its characteristics. The objective of understanding the basic factors that would
influence the optimal network design and served as a tool to guide our discussions with stakeholders. The toy model was tested in a small-scale problem with fictitious data.

# Final Model:
The final model built on the toy model by incorporating variable outreach site capacity and costs. Actual data from UNICEF and the Gambia was incorporated.
