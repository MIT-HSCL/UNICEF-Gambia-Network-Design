# UNICEF-Gambia-Network-Design
This project builds an optimization model for immunization network design that aims to maximize the access to immunization and incorporates the demand function which considers the effect of distance.

This work was completed as part of an [MIT SUpply Chain Management]{https://scm.mit.edu/) Capstone Project (May, 2020): [Development and Application of an Immunization Network Design Optimization Model](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/126392)
